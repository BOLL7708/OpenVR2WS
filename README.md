# OpenVR2WS
WebSocket server that outputs OpenVR data as JSON

For years I used a tool that I never published, called OpenVR2JSON, which used an HTTP-listener to output data on request. Now I'm doing a complete rewrite, instead opting for a web-socket server with two-way communication. Will also be adding input support back in, which stopped working for my old tool back in 2018. This is a work in progress that has just begun (2020-05-25)
